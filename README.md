I have developed a comprehensive system that empowers patients to book appointments, facilitates the clarification and analysis of X-rays within the system, and enables direct communication with doctors. This project involved utilizing technologies such as Livewire, Pusher Realtime, mcamara, Astrotomic Translation, and Polymorphic Relationships to deliver seamless functionality and enhance the user experience.
